# json-skill

A agent **Skill** for safely and efficiently doing CRUD (Create / Read /
Update / Delete) operations on JSON files — especially large ones where
reading the whole file would blow up the agent's context.

## Why

Agents that work with JSON face a dilemma:

- Reading the whole file consumes a lot of tokens and may not even fit.
- Without reading, the agent doesn't know what keys, types, or structure
  the file has, so it can't safely edit specific fields.

`json-crud` solves this with a **two-step workflow**:

1. **Inspect** — run `scripts/inspect.py` to get a compact tree summary:
   types, array lengths, key names, short sample values. Homogeneous
   arrays are collapsed to a single schema. Depth is capped so deep
   structures stay small.
2. **CRUD** — use `scripts/get.py`, `scripts/set.py`, `scripts/delete.py`
   to touch exactly the fields you care about, addressed by path.

The agent-facing documentation lives in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

## Why not just `jq` or a `python3 -c` one-liner?

Fair question. For pure get / set / delete, they work:

```bash
jq '.users[0].name' file.json                                    # read
jq '.users[0].name = "Alice"' file.json > tmp && mv tmp file.json  # update
jq 'del(.users[0].email)' file.json > tmp && mv tmp file.json      # delete
```

So the get / set / delete scripts here are really just an **agent-friendly
CLI wrapper** over what you could always do by hand. The value they add is
ergonomic, not capability:

| What the wrapper adds over `jq` / `python3 -c`             |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed 4-verb interface — no per-call quoting gymnastics    |
| Atomic writes (temp file + rename) so failed edits can't truncate the original |
| Consistent error messages (`key 'x' not found at a.b`)     |
| Unified path syntax across inspect / get / set / delete    |
| Auto-discovered by Claude Code via `SKILL.md`              |

**The thing you can't easily get from a one-liner is `inspect.py`.** Producing
a compact, depth-limited, homogeneous-array-collapsed structure summary with
sample values takes ~180 lines of Python. Equivalents with `jq` alone:

| You want                                | `jq` gives you                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| The whole shape                         | `jq .` — dumps everything (same problem)|
| Top-level keys only                     | `jq 'keys'` — flat, one level           |
| Types per key                           | `jq 'map_values(type)'` — one level     |
| Every path                              | `jq 'paths'` — no folding, explodes     |
| Compact, recursive, folded schema       | — no off-the-shelf answer               |

That last row is the real reason this skill exists. `get.py` / `set.py` /
`delete.py` are kept alongside it mostly for consistency and atomicity — if
you live in `jq` already, feel free to use it for those three.

## Install

Clone (or symlink) this repo into your Claude Code skills directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/<you>/json_crud ~/.claude/skills/json-crud
# — or —
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/skills/json-crud
```

No dependencies beyond Python 3.8+ stdlib.

## Quickstart

```
python3 scripts/inspect.py examples/sample.json
python3 scripts/inspect.py examples/sample.json --path config.database
python3 scripts/get.py     examples/sample.json 'users[0].name' --raw
python3 scripts/set.py     examples/sample.json 'users[0].name' 'Alicia'
python3 scripts/delete.py  examples/sample.json 'users[0].email'
```

## Command cheatsheet

| Command        | Purpose                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `inspect.py`   | Summarize structure (types, sizes, samples)               |
| `get.py`       | Read the value at a path                                  |
| `set.py`       | Create or update the value at a path                      |
| `delete.py`    | Remove the key or array element at a path                 |

Path syntax: `a.b.c` · `users[0].name` · `items[-1]` · `["weird.key"]`.

See [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) for full flags, edge cases, and common pitfalls.

## Run the tests

```
python3 -m unittest tests.test_roundtrip -v
```

## Known limitations

- **JSON only.** JSONL, YAML, TOML are out of scope for v1.
- **Format not preserved.** Writes reformat with `indent=2`; original
  spacing and key order of rewritten subtrees is not retained.
- **No comments / JSON5.** Strict JSON only.
- **Whole-file load.** Very large files (>a few hundred MB) load into
  memory; no streaming.
- **Duplicate keys.** stdlib `json` keeps the last one; we accept this.
- **No file locks.** Writes are atomic (temp file + rename), but there's
  no locking against concurrent writers.

## Roadmap (future work)

- JSONL support (per-line indexing)
- YAML / TOML via optional deps
- Streaming inspector for >1 GB files
- A subset of JSONPath (`$.users[*].name`) for multi-match reads
- Optional JSON Schema emission from `inspect.py`
